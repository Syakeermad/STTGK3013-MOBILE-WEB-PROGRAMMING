# Short README (max 1–2 pages)

## i. App name + 2–3 sentence description
**Savings Goal Tracker**  
A simple Flutter app that helps users estimate how long it will take to reach a savings goal.  
Users can input their target amount, weekly or monthly saving rate, and an optional starting balance to get an estimated time to achieve their goal.



## ii. Inputs → Process → Output explanation (bullet points)
**Inputs:**
- Target amount (RM)
- Saving per period (weekly/monthly)
- Starting balance (optional)
- Period frequency (dropdown)

**Process:**
- Remaining = Target – Starting balance  
- Weeks or months = Remaining ÷ Saving per period  

**Output:**
- Displays estimated time to reach the goal (weeks/days or months)



## iii. Widget list used
Text, TextField, DropdownButton, ElevatedButton, Row, Column, Container



## iv. Basic validation approach
- Uses `double.tryParse()` for numeric inputs  
- Ensures target and saving values are greater than 0  
- Shows error message if inputs are missing or invalid  
- Prevents crash on empty fields
